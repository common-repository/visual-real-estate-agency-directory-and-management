<h3>Themes compatible</h3>
<p>We tested on standard wordpress themes and free Total theme. My favourite is to use it on Total theme.</p>
<p>Of course plugin will probably work also with other themes but maybe some css changes will be required for perfect looking (Details about how to prepare theme is included in documentation).</p>
